# bindPredictDL21

bindPredictDL21 is a method to predict whether a residue in a protein is binding to metal ions, nucleic acids (DNA or RNA), or small molecules. Towards this end, bindPredictDL21 uses ProtT5 embeddings [1] as input to a 2-layer CNN. Since bindPredictDL21 is based on single sequences, it can easily be applied to any protein sequence.

## Data

The data set used for training and testing was extracted from BioLip [2]. The UniProt identifiers for the 5 splits used during cross-validation and the test set as well as the corresponding FASTA sequences and used binding annotations are made available in the `data` folder.

ProtT5 embeddings can be generated using [the bio_embeddings pipeline](https://github.com/sacdallago/bio_embeddings) [3].
